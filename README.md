# twitter_scraping
It is a simple project of fetching the users or hashtags information from Twitter. For this project we are going to use SNScrape for collect the twitter data. We are going to use Streamlit for frame work. Streamlit is a platform that used to give extra frame works for the project.

At first we have to import the necessary packages. Once the packages are imported we started the frame work part with the use Streamlit.

In the next part after the submit button is clicked the process begins. It will fetch the tweets that matches the user input and create it as dataframe. We can also download the fetched dataframe as CSV file and also in Json file. we can also upload the data into mongobd.
